## Migration Refactorings

### Constraint Migrations (2025-04)

Several migrations related to the `mandrill_webhook_secret` unique constraint have been refactored:

- `3d17b3a3f001_add_unique_constraint_to_mandrill_.py`: Empty migration (superseded)
- `7b40d1074b24_add_unique_constraint_to_mandrill_.py`: Initial implementation with basic error handling
- `daf60e35187d_fix_unique_constraint_for_postgres.py`: Final implementation with robust error handling

The refactoring:
1. Removed manual transaction management (`COMMIT` statements) which can lead to inconsistent states
2. Added proper logging instead of print statements
3. Added clear documentation about migration relationships
4. Maintained backward compatibility with existing deployed databases

All migrations are maintained in the chain for compatibility, but later migrations supersede earlier ones.
