# Session Management Refactoring Plan

## Issue Identified
The codebase currently has redundant session management files:
- `app/api/v1/deps.py` mostly re-exports from `app/api/v1/deps/`
- `app/db/session_management.py` contains only a `get_db` function
- Similar functionality exists in `app/api/v1/deps/database.py` and `app/db/session.py`

This redundancy creates confusion about which session management approach to use and violates the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Refactoring Goals
- Remove duplicate code
- Standardize on a single pattern for database session management
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing callers where possible
- Follow strict TDD methodology

## Testing Approach (TDD)
1. **RED**: Write failing tests that verify:
   - API endpoints continue to function after the refactoring
   - Database operations work correctly with the standardized session management
   - Scripts that use direct session access continue to function

2. **GREEN**: Implement the minimal refactoring required to make tests pass

3. **REFACTOR**: Apply quality tools (Black, isort, Flake8, Mypy) to ensure adherence to project standards

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up Test Cases (RED phase)
- Create test cases that exercise API endpoints using the current session management
- Create test cases for any scripts or utilities that directly use sessions
- Ensure these tests pass with the current implementation

### 2. Remove Redundant Files and Standardize (GREEN phase)
- Remove `app/api/v1/deps.py`:
  - Identify all imports of `app/api/v1/deps.py`
  - Adjust imports to reference the specific modules in `app/api/v1/deps/` directly
  - Verify that the `webhook_client_dependency` is indeed unused before removing
  
- Remove `app/db/session_management.py`:
  - Identify all imports of `get_db` from this file
  - Replace with dependency from `app/api/v1/deps/database.py`
  - For direct session needs (scripts), use `get_session` from `app/db/session.py`

### 3. Update Import Statements
- Modify all files that import from the removed modules
- Update the import paths to point to the correct standardized modules
- Run tests after each significant change to detect regressions early

### 4. Quality Assurance (REFACTOR phase)
- Run Black for formatting: `black .`
- Run isort for import sorting: `isort .`
- Run Flake8 for linting: `flake8 .`
- Run Mypy for type checking: `mypy app`
- Fix any issues identified by these tools

### 5. Verify Changes
- Run the full test suite to verify functionality is maintained
- Verify code coverage remains at or above previous levels
- Check that API endpoints function correctly
- Ensure scripts and utilities operate as expected

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass
- No duplicate session management code exists
- All code quality checks pass
- API functionality is preserved
- Imports reference a single, consistent set of session management utilities

## Rollback Plan
If issues are encountered:
- Revert the changes to the original state
- Analyze the failures
- Develop a revised approach that addresses the identified issues
